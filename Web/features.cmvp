		      <h4><a name="application">Application Information:</a></h4>
		      <p>CoffeeMud
		is written in 100% Java, listening as a server on any specified
		port(s). Built-in web servers can be activated to listen on specified
		ports.
		CoffeeMud supports any JDBC/ODBC database and has been successfully
		tested using MySQL, HSQLDB, and Derby over JDBC, and Access/SQL Server
		over ODBC. The package also includes a flat-file JDBC system for
		beginners.</p>
		      <p>The
		system includes an API that allows standard MOBs, Items, Weapons,
		Armor, Room types, Exit types, and Magic Items to be coded in less than
		a hundred lines using a template. Generic MOBS, Items, Weapons, Armor,
		and Exit types can be be molded to fit any design and spec. And all of
		it can be implemented online at run-time.</p>
		      <p>An
		advanced message passing system lies at the systems core. Messages are
		customized for the message source, message target, and how that message
		appears to everyone else in the room. Each message is coded with basic
		sensory information so that only the blind miss visual messages, while
		they don't miss the auditory ones. Messages can also be previewed and
		modified by every object involved, lending even more environmental
		realism to coding!</p>
