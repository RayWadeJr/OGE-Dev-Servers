<H2>OK, so what is Sancara?</H2>
</CENTER>
<P><B>Well, Sancara is a text-based video game world built on the Coffeemud game engine.</B>
<P>Coffeemud is a very large computer program that provides a
foundation upon which one can most efficiently build a text based MUD game. 

<p>When you enter the Sancara world, you are dedicating yourself
to weeks, months, even years of meticulously building your character with experience, stats, and abilities.

<p>Sancara provides a gathering place for
players from all over the internet to congregate for the purpose of imaginative adventuring. 

<p>Sancara is a fantasy & tech world in which the players reside and pursue
their adventures through skills and/or combat. 

<P>So, as you will see, those who wish to experience or play in Sancara do not
need to download a game engine in order to do so. It is recommended that you download one of the popular MUD clients like cMud or Mudlet. With those
clients you can connect to Sancara or any one of the hundreds of other existing MUDs which are running on the internet, and play to your hearts content.

<P>It is the TRULY adventurous among you, who wish to brave the world of Sancara.
<P><BR>Enjoy!<BR><I>Zetzer the Archon of Adran</I> </P>
